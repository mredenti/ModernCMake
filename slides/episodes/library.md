## CREATING A STATIC LIBRARY - HOW TO DO IT (I)


:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}

1. In the top level `CMakeLists.txt` file declare the global setup of our project. Additionally, include a call to the `add_subdirectory()` command to incorporate the `CMakeLists.txt` configuration from the `src` subdirectory

```{.cmake style=cmakestyle}
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.21)

project(Greetings LANGUAGES CXX)

add_subdirectory(src)
```

<!--
  These commands bring content from another file or directory into the build, allowing the
  build logic to be distributed across the directory hierarchy rather than forcing everything to be
  defined at the top-most level. This offers a number of advantages:
  - Build logic is localized, meaning that characteristics of the build can be defined in the directory
  where they have the most relevance.
  - Builds can be composed of subcomponents which are defined independently of the top level
  project consuming them. This is especially important if a project makes use of things like git
  submodules or embeds third party source trees.
  - Because directories can be self-contained, it becomes relatively trivial to turn parts of the build
  on or off simply by choosing whether to add in that directory.

  The add_subdirectory() command allows a project to bring another directory into the build. That
  directory must have its own CMakeLists.txt file which will be processed at the point where
  add_subdirectory() is called. A corresponding directory will be created in the projectâ€™s build tree.

  The sourceDir does not have to be a subdirectory within the source tree, although it usually is. Any
  directory can be added, with sourceDir being specified as either an absolute or relative path, the
  latter being relative to the current source directory. Absolute paths are typically only needed when
  adding directories that are outside the main source tree.

## CREATING A STATIC LIBRARY - HOW TO DO IT (II)

<!-- 
  These two new files will also have to be compiled and we have to modify CMakeLists.txt accordingly. However, in this example we want to compile them first into a library, and not directly into the executable
-->


:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}

<!--
  We will encounter the term target repeatedly. In CMake, a target is any object given as first argument to add_executable or add_library. Targets are the basic atom in CMake. Whenever you will need to organize complex projects, think in terms of its targets and their mutual dependencies. The whole family of CMake commands target_* can be used to express chains of dependencies and is much more effective than keeping track of state with variables. 
-->

2. Create a new **target**, this time a static library. The name of the library will be name of the target and the sources are listed as follows

    ```{.cmake style=cmakestyle}
    add_library(greetings 
                STATIC 
                    greetings.hpp greetings.cpp) 
    ```
<!-- 
   - add_library(message STATIC Message.hpp Message.cpp): This will
   generate the necessary build tool instructions for compiling the specified sources into a library.


   - The first argument to add_library is the name of the target. The
   same name can be used throughout CMakeLists.txt to refer to the library. The
   actual name of the generated library will be formed by CMake by adding the
   prefix lib in front and the appropriate extension as a suffix. The library
   extension is determined based on the second argument, STATIC or SHARED, and
   the operating system.
-->

1. The creation of the **target** for the `hello` executable is unmodified

    ```{.cmake style=cmakestyle}
    add_executable(hello hello.cpp) 
    ```

:::

\begin{forest}
  pic dir tree,
  where level=0{}{
    directory,
  },
  [ 
    [greetings
      [CMakeLists.txt, file
      ]
      [src
        [\colorbox{pink}{CMakeLists.txt}, file
        ]
        [greetings.hpp, file
        ]
        [greetings.cpp, file
        ]
        [hello.cpp, file

    ]
  ]
\end{forest}

4. Finally we have to tell CMake that the `greetings` library target has to be linked into the `hello` executable target

    ```{.cmake style=cmakestyle}
    target_link_libraries(hello greetings)
    ```

## HOW IT WORKS - ADD_LIBRARY()

```{.cmake style=cmakestyle}
add_library(greetings STATIC greetings.hpp greetings.cpp) 
```

- Generates the necessary build instructions for compiling the specified sources, `Greetings.cpp`, into a **STATIC** library

- The name of the target, `greetings`, can be used troughout `CMakeLists.txt` to refer to the library

- The actual name of the generated library will be formed by CMake by adding the prefix `lib` in front and the appropriate extension as a suffix, determined based on the second argument (**STATIC**, **SHARED**, ...)  and the OS.


## HOW IT WORKS - TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES()

\vspace{.5cm}

```{.cmake style=cmakestyle}
target_link_libraries(hello greetings)
```

<!--
  We will encounter the term target repeatedly. In CMake, a target is any object given as first argument to add_executable or add_library. Targets are the basic atom in CMake. Whenever you will need to organize complex projects, think in terms of its targets and their mutual dependencies. The whole family of CMake commands target_* can be used to express chains of dependencies and is much more effective than keeping track of state with variables. 

  - target_link_libraries(hello-world message): Links the library into the
executable. This command will also guarantee that the hello-world executable
properly depends on the message library. We thus ensure that the message
library is always built before we attempt to link it to the hello-world
executable.

- After successful compilation, the build directory will contain the libmessage.a static
library (on GNU/Linux) and the hello-world executable.
-->

- Guarantees that the `hello` target depends on the message library $\Rightarrow$ the **greetings** library is built before being linked it to the `hello` executable

    ```{.bash style=bashstyle}
    $ cmake --build ./build 
    [ 25%] Building CXX object src/CMakeFiles/greetings.dir/greetings.cpp.o
    [ 50%] Linking CXX static library libgreetings.a
    @[ 50%] Built target greetings@
    [ 75%] Building CXX object src/CMakeFiles/hello.dir/hello.cpp.o
    [100%] Linking CXX executable hello
    @[100%] Built target hello@
    ```

<!--

-->

<!-- 
  After successful compilation, the build directory will contain the libmessage.a static
  library (on GNU/Linux) and the hello-world executable

## LIBRARY TYPES: STATIC, SHARED, OBJECT 

            
```{.cmake style=cmakestyle}
add_library(<name> [STATIC | SHARED | OBJECT ]
                    [<source>...])
                    [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
```

**STATIC** 
 : used to create static libraries, that is, archives of object files for use when linking other targets


**SHARED**
  : used to create shared libraries, that is, libraries that can be linked dynamically and loaded at runtime
  
**OBJECT** 
  : used to compile the sources in the list given to `add_library()` to object files, but then neither archiving them into a static library nor linking them into a shared object. 
  

<!-- 

CMake accepts other values as valid for the second argument to add_library and we will
encounter all of them in the rest of the book:
STATIC, which we have already encountered, will be used to create static
libraries, that is, archives of object files for use when linking other targets, such as
executables.
SHARED will be used to create shared libraries, that is, libraries that can be linked
dynamically and loaded at runtime. Switching from a static library to a dynamic
shared object (DSO) is as easy as using add_library(message SHARED
Message.hpp Message.cpp) in CMakeLists.txt.
OBJECT can be used to compile the sources in the list given to add_library to
object files, but then neither archiving them into a static library nor linking them
into a shared object. The use of object libraries is particularly useful if one needs
to create both static and shared libraries in one go. We will demonstrate this in
this recipe.
MODULE libraries are once again DSOs. In contrast to SHARED libraries, they are
not linked to any other target within the project, but may be loaded dynamically
later on. This is the argument to use when building a runtime plugin.

## IMPORTED TARGETS 

CMake is also able to generate special types of libraries. These produce no output in the
build system but are extremely helpful in organizing dependencies and build requirements
between targets:
IMPORTED, this type of library target represents a library located outside the
project. The main use for this type of library is to model pre-existing
dependencies of the project that are provided by upstream packages. As such
IMPORTED libraries are to be treated as immutable. We will show examples of
using IMPORTED libraries throughout the rest of the book. See also: https:/ /
cmake. org/ cmake/ help/ latest/ manual/ cmake- buildsystem. 7. html#importedtargets

INTERFACE, this special type of CMake library is similar to an IMPORTED library,
but is mutable and has no location. Its main use case is to model usage
requirements for a target that is outside our project. We will show a use case for
INTERFACE libraries in Recipe 5, Distributing a project with dependencies as Conda
package, in Chapter 11, Packaging Projects. See also: https:/ / cmake. org/ cmake/
help/ latest/ manual/ cmake- buildsystem. 7. html#interface- libraries
ALIAS, as the name suggests, a library of this type defines an alias for a preexisting
library target within the project. It is thus not possible to choose an alias
for an IMPORTED library. See also: https:/ / cmake. org/ cmake/ help/ latest/
manual/ cmake- buildsystem. 7. html#alias- libraries

## GRAPHVIZ OF DEPENDENCIES

- CMake can use the Graphviz graph visualization software (http://www.graphviz.org) to
generate the dependency graph of a project:

    ```{.bash style=bashstyle}
    $ cmake -B ./build -S . --graphviz=greetings.dot
    $ dot -T png greetings.dot -o greetings.png
    ```

The generated diagram will show dependencies between targets in different directories

- object libraries -- how to I access them when compiled, do I get a target for each object -- how do I create a object for each and then use them as a library

We will encounter the term target repeatedly. In CMake, a target is any object given as first argument to add_executable or add_library. Targets are the basic atom in CMake. Whenever you will need to organize complex projects, think in terms of its targets and their mutual dependencies. The whole family of CMake commands target_* can be used to express chains of dependencies and is much more effective than keeping track of state with variables.

  IMPORTANCE ABOUT SCOPE

  Targets are visible at any scope after the point that they have been defined. Regular (non-cache) variables are scoped to directories, functions, and block()s, and are only visible to script code in the same directory function, and block scope (same function scope, and same directory level, or subdirectories added by add_subdirectory). To define a variable in the parent directory's scope, you must define it like set(<variable> <value>... PARENT_SCOPE).
