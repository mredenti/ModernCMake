# Introduction to CMake

## MOTIVATION 

- **productivity** spend time on software development, not software building 

## WHAT IS CMAKE

- CMake is a build file generator which means that it generates files but it does not actually build

- In CMake you write scripts called CMakeLists.txt which describe the build in a compiler and platform independent language

- Uses CMake language which is quite flexible as it allows scripting ...

- CMake allows you to build, test and package your software

## CMake Features 

- CMake is very popular such that it has been widely adopted across all major IDEs. This integration allows to open a CMake project, debug and so on directly through the IDE (interface)

- Perhaps it is not integrates with XCode but it can generate XCode files
